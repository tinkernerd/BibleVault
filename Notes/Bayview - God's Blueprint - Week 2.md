> “Do you act the same way at home as you do in the church?”

---

## 🧭 Key Theme

**How we act in our house reflects how we act in the church.**  
In order for God's household (the church) to be healthy, our *personal households* must be godly.  
We cannot be different in church and at home — our faith must be consistent across both.

---

## 1️⃣ Prayer — The Center of the House

> “Prayer needs to be the heartbeat of the home.”

- Pray for **needs**, **others**, and **all people**.  
- Keep communication with God open at all times.  
- A prayerful home becomes a peaceful home.  

📖 **Reference:** [[1Thess 5#17]]  
> *Pray without ceasing.*

---

## 2️⃣ Live — Reflect Christ in Everyday Life

> “Our lifestyle should preach before our words ever do.”

- The way we live at home should reflect Christ’s love and humility.  
- Let your actions show your faith long before your words do.  

📖 **Reference:** [[Eph 5]]  
> *Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children and walk in love...*

---

## 3️⃣ Lead — Begin Leadership in the Home

> “Before you can lead anywhere else, you must first lead your own household.”

- Leadership begins with stewardship — of your heart, family, and time.  
- Guard your heart above all else.  
- A godly leader doesn’t demand respect; they earn it through example and consistency.  

📖 **Reference:** [[1Tim 3#5]]  
> *If anyone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of God’s church?*

🎵 **Song:** [Lead Me — Sanctus Real](https://youtu.be/yLr6G8Xy5uc?si=59D7E3EJS40hSts7)

## 4️⃣ Stand — Build on a Firm Foundation

> “If the house has a steady foundation, everything flows from there.”

- Stand for God’s Word within the home — it’s the foundation.  
- Don’t compromise biblical truth for comfort or culture.  
- Let Scripture be your standard and your stability.  

📖 **Reference:** [[1Tim 3#10]]  
> *They must first be tested; then if there is nothing against them, let them serve...*

---

## 💭 Reflection & Challenge

- Is **prayer** truly the center of your home?  
- Does your **lifestyle** at home mirror your faith in church?  
- Are you **leading** your household the way God calls you to?  
- Is your **foundation** built firmly on Scripture?
